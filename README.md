# Marco Polo

This game is essentially going to be a replica of Marco Polo. So far I have synced movement with
all clients. All users have to ready up before the game starts. Once the game starts, the seeker
will be shown in red, while all the others will be shown in black. All clients can see one another
except for the seeker, the seeker can only see themselves until they call out "Marco", then once
all the clients reply "Polo" their locations will be temporarily revealed. The seeker will have to
collide with all the other players to win the round. Right now I have everything but the collisions
comepleted, the seeker can see other player's locations by hitting the spacebar. This will be limited
to a small time interval in the final product
